Muon

Muon is a versatile and feature-rich online shop module for WebsiteBaker and Lepton CMS.

Note that this is a fork of the original Bakery shop module, which is still under
development and can be found here: http://bakery-shop.ch/

If you seek a proven and stable version plus support through the WebsiteBaker forum I
strongly recommend using the original. If, however, you seek for a more advanced version
and you know your onions regarding CSS, JS and a little PHP, you may try this fork, which
- amongst others - provides the following features:

- complete re-work of frontend output to modern HTML and CSS
- free optional textarea for every item
- Realtime Price Calculation (rpc.js) when choosing different options in item view
- Precautions taken to meet German button law specifications
- Several template placeholders dedicated to webanalytics addicts to make their statistics shine
- lots of more stuff

For a comprehensive list please refer to the CHANGELOG.

Why I did this? Well, because I had fun doing so, getting rid of things that annoyed me
and by the same time improving my PHP skills and learning to handle a somewhat bigger
project.

Thanks for using and have fun :-)
